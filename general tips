Found an error in the script that introduced the artifacts.
There is a bug in the Merge nodes Over operation
probably liked to the internal order of operation.
If you'll mix the over node to limit the opacity of
the A pipe RGB values in the result are changed
even thou it's outside the bbox and evidently have
zero values in all channels.
The problem only occurs when the mix slider goes
below 0.48 on the 0-1 scale.
